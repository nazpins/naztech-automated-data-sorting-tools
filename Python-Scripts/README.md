## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- Conda package manager (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nazpins/naztech-software/edit/main/Python-Scripts.git
   ```
2. Double-click the `.bat` file and follow the prompts to provide the necessary inputs.

## Scripts

1. `backup_files.py`: Automate the backup of important files and directories to a local or remote location, with options for compression and encryption.

2. `compare_file_contents.py`: Compare the contents of two files or directories, highlighting differences and similarities.

3. `create_conda_env.py`: Create a new Conda environment for a machine learning project, installing common libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn.

4. `encrypt_decrypt_files.py`: Encrypt and decrypt files using symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms.

5. `generate_data_reports.py`: Generate data reports from various data sources (e.g., databases, APIs), with options for customizing the report format and content.

6. `manage_user_accounts.py`: Manage user accounts, including creating, modifying, and deleting user profiles.

7. `merge_csv_files.py`: Merge multiple CSV files into a single file, with options for handling headers and data types.

8. `monitor_network_traffic.py`: Monitor network traffic, including incoming and outgoing connections, with options for filtering and logging.

9. `monitor_process_memory.py`: Monitor the memory usage of specific processes, with options for logging and alerting when thresholds are exceeded.

10. `monitor_system_resources.py`: Monitor system resources like CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk space, with options for logging and alerting.

11. `organize_files_by_type.py`: Organize files in a directory by their file types (e.g., images, documents, videos), creating subdirectories for each type.

12. `password_generator.py`: Generate strong, random passwords of a specified length and complexity.

13. `rename_files_in_bulk.py`: Rename multiple files in a directory based on a specified pattern or convention.

14. `scan_open_ports.py`: Scan a network for open ports on specified hosts or IP ranges.

## Usage

Each script has a corresponding `.bat` file for easy execution on Windows systems. Double-click the `.bat` file and follow the prompts to provide the necessary inputs.

For Linux and macOS users, run the Python scripts directly from the command line:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the script you want to run.

## Customization

Feel free to modify and customize the scripts to suit your specific needs. You can add additional features, change the input prompts, or integrate the scripts into your existing workflows.
